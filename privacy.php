                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
                    <h3>a) Personal Information You Give Us</h3>
                    <p>We collect information that you voluntarily share with us through the Moba Platform.</p>
                    <p>If you are using the Moba Platform to request professional services, or contact Moba or its third-party service providers, you may give us:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact information and identifiers, such as your name, physical address, telephone number, and email address</li>
                        <li>Log-in information and identifiers, including your Moba Platform username and password,&nbsp;</li>
                        <li>Information about your home, such as the number of bedrooms, the types of appliances, zip code or postal code where your home is located and your instructions for servicing your home</li>
                        <li>Billing information, such as credit or debit card number, expiration date &amp; security code and/or information regarding digital payment accounts and the Moba Platform itself</li>
                        <li>Ratings and reviews of the service professionals you engage through the Moba Platform</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you participate on the Moba Platform as a service professional, or contact Moba or its third-party service providers, you may give us:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact information and identifiers, such as your name, email address, mailing address, and phone number</li>
                        <li>Log-in information and identifiers, including your Moba Platform username and password</li>
                        <li>Application information, if requesting consideration to participate as a service professional through the Moba Platform, such as your experience, skills, eligibility to work, and availability</li>
                        <li>Photographs of yourself</li>
                        <li>App questionnaire information, which may include responses to questions about your wellbeing, as well as your knowledge and acceptance of any specific terms or policies governing a job</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you apply on the Moba Platform for employment with Moba, you may give us:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Contact information and identifiers, including your name, email address, telephone number, and mailing address</li>
                        <li>Resume and LinkedIn profile</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><u>More about payment card information:</u></p>
                    <p>Although users can submit credit / debit card or other payment card information to pay for a service through the Moba Platform, Moba does not receive this information itself. Payment card information is transmitted directly to a third-party payment card processor, through an Internet connection secured by industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption technology. The third-party payment card processor communicates to Moba whether your payment has cleared, but does not provide payment card information to Moba.</p>
                    <h3>Surveys</h3>
                    <p>You may, at your choice, complete surveys on the Moba Platform or distributed by Moba about, for example, your level of satisfaction with the Moba Platform, your engagement with the Moba Platform, and your awareness of Moba Platform features. In some cases, we may link the information you provide in the survey with Personal Information in your Moba account, such as your name or email address. When linked to Personal Information, your survey information becomes Personal Information too.</p>
                    <h3>b) Information We Collect Through Technology</h3>
                    <p>We collect information through technology to enhance our ability to serve you. When you access and use the Moba Platform, or contact Moba or its third-party service providers, Moba and, in some cases, our third-party service providers collect information about you or how you interact with the Moba Platform. We describe below a few of the methods we use to collect information through technology.</p>
                    <p>When you visit the Moba Platform, we collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is often associated with the portal you used to enter the Internet, like your Internet service provider (ISP), company, association, or university. While an IP address may reveal your ISP or geographic area, we cannot determine your identity solely based upon your IP address. However, we may link the last IP address you used to access the Moba Platform to Personal Information you provide us. Where, according to local law, IP addresses and the like are considered Personal Information, we treat them as such.</p>
                    <p>We may also collect a unique identifier for your computer, mobile device, or other device used to access the Moba Platform (<strong>&quot;Device Identifier&quot;</strong>). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device you used to access the Moba Platform. We may link the Device Identifier to other information about your visit, such as what pages you viewed, and to Personal Information you provide us, such as your name. In addition to these methods, we may also collect information about how you interact with the Moba Platform through advertising partners and data enrichment tools.</p>
                    <h3>Do We Use Cookies?</h3>
                    <p>Yes.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
                    <p>We may include small graphic images or other web programming code, called web beacons (also known as &quot;pixel tags&quot;, &quot;web bugs&quot; or &quot;clear GIFs&quot;), in our web and mobile pages and messages. The web beacons are minute graphics with a unique identifier. They are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored in a user&apos;s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons help us better manage content on the Moba Platform by informing us what content is effective, monitoring how users navigate the Moba Platform, counting users of the Moba Platform, and counting how many e-mails sent by us were actually opened.</p>
                    <h3>Your &apos;Do Not Track&apos; Browser Setting</h3>
                    <p>We do not support the Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting. DNT is a preference you can set in your browser&apos;s settings to let the websites you visit know that you do not want the websites collecting your Personal Information.</p>
                    <p>We do track your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. For example, we use web beacons to help us determine what links or advertisers brought you to our Site. We also use third-party service providers to display advertisements to you on other websites based on your activities while on the Moba Platform.</p>
                    <h3>c) Information Collected by Mobile Applications</h3>
                    <p>When you use the App, the App may automatically collect and store some or all of the following information from your mobile device (<strong>&quot;Mobile Device Information&quot;</strong>), including, but not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The type of Internet browsers you use with the App.</li>
                        <li>Your preferred country site.</li>
                        <li>Your mobile operating system.</li>
                        <li>Your phone number or other identifiers assigned to your mobile device, including: The IP address of your mobile device, The manufacturer and model of your mobile device</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We may also collect information about how you use the App, such as the amount of time you spend using the App, how many times you use a specific feature of the App over a given time period, how often you use the App, and actions you take in the App. In addition, we may gather information about the website from which you downloaded the App to help us determine what App download site is most effective (collectively <strong>&quot;App Usage Information&quot;</strong>).</p>
                    <p>We may link your Mobile Device Information and App Usage Information to Personal Information you have provided us, in which case we will treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>
                    <h3>Location Tracking</h3>
                    <p>If you are a service professional using Moba&apos;s mobile application for service professionals, we may collect your geographic location by using Global Positioning System (GPS) information sent to us.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>We only collect location information about service professionals who have been accepted to participate on the Moba Platform and not about service requesters or about service professionals applying to participate in the Moba Platform.</p>
                    <h3>d) Information You Provide About A Third Party</h3>
                    <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about the Moba Platform, we may collect your friend&apos;s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Moba Platform. We store this information only to send this one-time email and to track the success of our referral program. We do not use this information for any other marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you refer a friend, your e-mail address may be included in the message sent to your friend.</p>
                    <p>If you are using the Moba Platform to request professional services, you may provide us ratings and reviews of the service professionals you engage through the Moba Platform.</p>
                    <h3>e) Information Third Parties Provide About You</h3>
                    <p><strong>Conversion Tracking</strong>: We may supplement the information we collect about you through the Moba Platform with records received from third parties in order to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor our content to you, and to offer you information that we believe may be of interest to you. For example, websites on which we have placed advertisements, such as Google, may tell us which ads about Moba you clicked. This is often called &quot;conversion tracking.&quot;</p>
                    <p><strong>Background Checks</strong>: In addition, when third parties conduct background checks on service professionals, those third parties share the results of the background check with Moba.</p>
                    <p><strong>Recording Phone Calls</strong>: Selected third-parties, including those who may assist in providing customer service support, may monitor and/or record the contents of phone calls made through or in relation to the Moba Platform, after notice to you and with your consent.</p>
                    <p><strong>Social Networking Sites</strong>: If you login to the Moba Platform through a social networking site, such as Facebook, we may collect your Facebook authentication token and account identification number and use that information to provide you with access to your account on the Moba Platform.</p>
                    <p><strong>Ratings and Reviews</strong>: If you are using the Moba Platform as a service professional, we may receive information about you in the form of ratings and reviews from requesters who engaged your professional services through the Moba Platform.</p>
                    <p><strong>Photographs of Completed Services</strong>: If you are using the Moba Platform to request services, service professionals booked through the Moba Platform may take photographs of completed services and provide them to Moba.</p>
                    <p><strong>Message Interception</strong>: If you call or text (SMS) message a service professional or service requester using the telephone number provided by Moba, Moba may mask your telephone number. During this process, Moba receives in real time and store call data, including the date and time of the call or text (SMS) message, the parties&rsquo; phone numbers, and the content of the text (SMS) messages.</p>
                    <p>If you send a message to a service professional or service requester in the App, Moba receives in real time and store message data, including the date, time, and content of the messages.</p>
                    <p>If you are using the Moba Platform as a service professional, we may receive information about you in the form of ratings and reviews from Requesters who engaged your professional services through the Moba Platform.</p>
                    <p>We will apply this Privacy Policy to any Personal Information received from third parties, unless we have disclosed otherwise.</p>
                    <h3>f) Information You Provide to a Third Party</h3>
                    <p>The Moba Platform includes links from the Moba Platform to sites or applications operated by third parties (<strong>&quot;Third-Party Sites&quot;</strong>) and plug-ins (such as Twitter buttons) from Third-Party Sites.</p>
                    <p>For example, service professionals may be directed to a Third Party Site, so that the Third Party Site can conduct a background check. The Third Party Site may ask the service professional for identifying information to conduct the background check.</p>
                    <p>Some Third-Party Sites link to Moba and share information with Moba. Moba does not control any Third-Party Sites, and is not responsible for any information they may collect. The information collection practices of a Third-Party Site are governed by that site&apos;s privacy policy.</p>
                    <p>We recommend that you read the Third-Party Site&apos;s privacy policy if you choose to enter any Third-Party Site or click on a plug-in.</p>

                    <p>The security and confidentiality of your Personal Information is important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access or disclosure and improper use.</p>
                    <p>For example, when users book services, the information they input is encrypted through TLS encryption. We do not store credit / debit card information on our servers, and we use TLS encryption to protect your credit card information when it is transferred to our third-party payment processor. In addition, access to your Personal Information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the Personal Information to perform a specific job, for example, sales representatives, managers, and customer service staff, are granted access to Personal Information. All employees with access to Personal Information are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. After a new policy is added, these employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to enhance protection for our users&apos; Personal Information.</p>
                    <p>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your account password and to your computer. Be sure to log out of your account or to close your browser after you have completed your visit to our Site.</p>
                    <p>Please note that despite our reasonable efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Information.</p>
                    <h3>V. YOUR CHOICES REGARDING THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
                    <p>You may contact <a href="mailto:info@moba.com.ng">info@moba.com.ng</a> to update, correct, or delete your Personal Information. You may also update, correct, and delete some of your Personal Information through your account on the Moba Platform.</p>
