                    <p>a. <u>The Moba Platform.</u> The Moba Platform is a technology platform that makes available certain home services to individuals seeking to obtain home services (&ldquo;Requesters&rdquo;) that Moba fulfills using independently-established home service providers customarily engaged in a trade, occupation and/or business of providing the services requested (&ldquo;Professionals&rdquo;). Those certain services requested by the Requesters, which are to be completed by the Professionals, are hereinafter referred to as <strong>&quot;Professional Services&quot;</strong>. The Professional Services may include repairs of electronics, installation and/or assembly of home items, provision of personal home service etc. MOBA, THROUGH THE MOBA PLATFORM, OFFERS INFORMATION AND A METHOD TO OBTAIN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, BUT DOES NOT AND DOES NOT INTEND TO PROVIDE SUCH PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ITSELF OR ACT IN ANY WAY AS A PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PROVIDER, AND EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND/OR MERCHANDISE PROVIDED TO THE REQUESTER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF GOOD AND WORKMANLIKE SERVICES, WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE.

                    <p>b. <u>Screening and Licensing.</u> FOR PROFESSIONALS THAT REGISTER TO USE THE MOBA PLATFORM IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, MOBA CHECKS THE BACKGROUNDS OF PROFESSIONALS VIA THIRD PARTY BACKGROUND CHECK SERVICES. FOR PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE ENTITIES THE BACKGROUND CHECK IS LIMITED TO THE OWNER/PRINCIPAL OF THE COMPANY, AND MAY BE COMPLETED AFTER THE PROFESSIONAL CLAIMS AND PERFORMS THEIR FIRST JOB THROUGH THE MOBA PLATFORM. Each Requester should exercise caution and common sense to protect its personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with any person whom you do not know. MOBA PERFORMS SCREENING SOLELY AT THE TIME THE PROFESSIONAL APPLIES TO REGISTER ON THE MOBA PLATFORM AND/OR AFTER A PROFESSIONAL COMPLETES THEIR FIRST JOB THROUGH THE MOBA PLATFORM. MOBA CANNOT AND DOES NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT THAT A PROFESSIONAL&apos;S PROFILE AND BACKGROUND CHECK SCREENING INFORMATION IS UP TO DATE. MOBA IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE A PROFESSIONAL&apos;S BACKGROUND CHECK OR PROFILE.

                    <h3>3. Payments; Recurring Services and Recurring Charges; Moba Happiness Guarantee; Claims;&nbsp;</h3>
                    <p>a. Payments. Requesters are obligated to pay in advance for those Professional Services they OBTAIN through the Moba Platform <strong>(&quot;Payments&quot;)</strong>. Prior to the scheduled Professional Service, we will charge the Requester&apos;s credit / debit card according to the amount the Requester has agreed to on the Moba Platform with respect to those Professional Services, the Requester has ordered, and for all purchases and payments for reimbursement costs, fees, expenses or applicable taxes associated with a Professional Service as well as the Trust and Support Fee<span style="line-height:107%;">&nbsp;as defined in 3(e) below), and the Requester hereby authorizes us to charge the credit / debit card on file in the Requester&apos;s Moba Platform account for such amounts. We will use third party services to process credit / debit card information. By accepting this Agreement, you are giving Moba (or a third-party payment processor on Moba&apos;s behalf) permission to charge your on-file credit card, debit card, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you owe Moba. Depending on the transaction you selected or services requested, Moba may charge you on a one-time or recurring basis. All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Professional Services must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with Moba at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. We retain the right, in our sole discretion, to place a hold on the Requester&apos;s credit / debit card for an ordered or completed Professional Service transaction. Seventy-two (72) hours after a Professional Service is completed, if there is no complaint by the Requester, we will mark the Professional Service as closed. All Payments by Requesters must be made through the Moba Platform. Any Payments paid, or any Professional Services scheduled or obtained outside of the Moba Platform are not subject to our Moba Happiness Guarantee in Section 3(d). Except for the Moba Happiness Guarantee in Section 3(d), no refunds or credits will be provided once the Requester&apos;s credit/debit card has been charged, except that at our sole discretion, refunds or credits may be granted in extenuating circumstances, as a result of specific promotions, or to correct any errors we have made. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of all credit card/debit card and all other personal information, we expressly disclaim any liability for any damage that may result should any information be released to third parties, and you agree to hold us harmless for any damages that may result therefrom. Requesters will be liable for all transaction taxes on the Professional Service(s) provided (other than taxes based on Moba&apos;s income). If we determine that your actions or performance may result in returns, chargebacks, claims, disputes, violations of our terms or policies, or other risks to Moba or third parties, then Moba may withhold any payments to you for as long as we determine any related risks to Moba or third parties persist. For any amounts that we determine you owe us, we may (i) offset any amounts that are payable by you to us (in reimbursement or otherwise) against any payments we may make to you or amounts we may owe you; (ii) invoice you for amounts due to us, in which case you will pay the invoiced amounts upon receipt; (iii) reverse any credits to your bank account; or (iv) collect payment or reimbursement from you by any other lawful means. If we determine that your account has been used to engage in deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or to repeatedly violate this Agreement, then we may in our sole discretion permanently withhold any payments to you.</p>
                    <p>b. <u>Job Rate.</u> The rate for a Professional Service (<strong>&quot;Job Rate&quot;</strong>) as determined by Moba depends on factors, such as location and how frequently a Recurrent Service is ordered, and payment terms may increase. Therefore, the same Professional Service may cost more in a different location or if the Professional Service is ordered less frequently. However, you will be notified prior to any such payment increase with sufficient notice to enable you to cancel the Recurrent Service as set forth herein.</p>
                    <p>c. <u>Recurrent Service with Automatic Renewal and Recurring Charges.</u></p>
                    <p>(i) Recurring Service: When requesting certain Professional Services, Requesters may have the option of choosing that the Professional Service be repeated on a regular basis (<strong>&quot;Recurrent Service&quot;</strong>). For example, a Requester may choose that a cleaning be performed every two weeks. When a Requester chooses a Recurrent Service, the Moba platform will automatically schedule that Recurrent Service to occur on future dates indefinitely at the frequency requested by Requester. Moba cannot guarantee that the same Professional will be available for each Recurrent Service appointment or that Recurrent Service appointments will not be canceled.</p>
                    <p>(ii) BILLING, RECURRING CHARGES AND AUTOMATIC RENEWAL: When a Requester signs up for a Recurring Service, Requester will be charged immediately for the initial booking. THEREAFTER, REQUESTER&apos;S AGREEMENT TO PAY FOR THE PROFESSIONAL SERVICE WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND REQUESTER&apos;S CREDIT / DEBIT CARD WILL BE CHARGED THE SAME NON-PROMOTIONAL AMOUNT, AS ORIGINALLY DISCLOSED TO REQUESTER AT THE TIME OF SIGNING UP FOR THE RECURRING SERVICE, IN ADVANCE OF EACH AUTOMATICALLY SCHEDULED PROFESSIONAL SERVICE APPOINTMENT, AS WELL AS FOR ANY APPLICABLE CANCELLATION FEES AND TAXES.</p>
                    <p>(iii) CANCELLATION OF AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING RECURRING SERVICE: Requesters may cancel the automatically renewing Recurrent Service AT ANY TIME by visiting the Moba Help Center at&nbsp;www.moba.com.ng/help&nbsp;or by mailing a notice of cancellation to Moba Attn HELP CENTRE MANAGER REQUESTERS MUST CANCEL MORE THAN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS PRIOR TO THEIR NEXT PROFESSIONAL SERVICE IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING CHARGED CANCELLATION FEES AND/OR FOR THEIR NEXT PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PURSUANT TO MOBA&apos;S CANCELLATION POLICY AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 4(e).</p>
                    <p>d. <u>Moba Happiness Guarantee.</u></p>
                    <p>i. The Moba Happiness Guarantee provides certain limited additional protections provided by Moba for Professional Services. Subject to the below exclusions and the terms and conditions and limitations herein, if you are dissatisfied with the performance of a Professional Service, Moba, in its sole discretion, will either (a) have the specific Professional Service reperformed or (b) compensate Requesters with a discount of not more than 5 percent. The Service Requester is eligible for the Moba Happiness Guarantee provided that the Requester reports the issue within fourty - eight (48) hours of the Professional Service appointment to our Requester service by visiting the Moba Help Center at&nbsp;www.moba.com.ng/help. If the Service Requester does not report the issue within fourty - eight (48) hours of the Professional&apos;s completion of the Professional Service, the claim is ineligible for the Moba Happiness Guarantee. For Recurring Services, each Professional Service is treated as a separate occurrence.</p>
                    <p>ii. If you carry insurance that would cover you in the event of a claim, such as renter&apos;s insurance, homeowner&apos;s insurance, automobile insurance or an umbrella policy (&quot;Personal Insurance&quot;), You agree that your Personal Insurance is primary and the Moba Happiness Guarantee is secondary. The Moba Happiness Guarantee will only compensate for losses to the extent not otherwise covered by your Personal Insurance and only as permitted herein.</p>
                    <p>iii. A Requester will be covered under the Moba Happiness Guarantee for a Professional Service, subject to the exclusions in subsection (v) below, provided:</p>
                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li>The Professional Service is paid for in full through the Moba Platform;</li>
                        <li>The Requester has not violated this Agreement;</li>
                        <li>The Requester has reported the claim within 48 hours of the Professional&apos;s completion of the Professional Service;</li>
                        <li>The Requester&apos;s Moba account is in good standing with no outstanding balances owed to Moba;</li>
                        <li>The Requester has identified fragile and other breakable items and communicated the location and identity of those items to the Professional prior to the start of the Professional Service; and</li>
                        <li>The Requestor has accounted for and secured all valuables prior to the start of a Professional Service.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>iv. What is excluded from the Moba Happiness Guarantee? The &quot;Moba Happiness Guarantee&quot; does not cover the following:</p>
                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li>Any Professional Service that is not booked and paid for directly on the Moba Platform;</li>
                        <li>Merchandise;</li>
                        <li>losses arising out of third party default or acts of nature, including, but not limited to, pollution, and weather-related events such as heavy rains, and flooding;</li>
                        <li>losses arising out of interruption of business, loss of market, loss of income and/or loss of use;</li>

                    <h3>17.Mutual Arbitration Agreement.</h3>
                    <p>a. <u>Informal Negotiations.</u> To expedite resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim, past, present, or future, between you and Moba, including without limitation any dispute or claim related to or arising out of this Agreement (<strong>&quot;Dispute&quot;</strong>), you and Moba may attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally (the <strong>&quot;Informal Negotiations&quot;</strong>) before initiating any arbitration or court proceeding.

Moba&apos;s address for such notices is: by electronic mail to info@moba.com.ng, Attn: Legal Manager.</p>
                    <p>b. <u>Arbitration.</u> If a Dispute is not resolved through Informal Negotiations, you and Moba agree to resolve any and all Disputes (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) through final and binding arbitration (<strong>&quot;Arbitration Agreement&quot;</strong>). This Arbitration Agreement shall be governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, Cap. A18, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>c. <u>Excluded Disputes.</u> You and Moba agree that the following Disputes are excluded from this Arbitration Agreement: (1) any Dispute seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or our intellectual property rights.</p>

                    <p>You and Moba agree to bring any Dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not as a class or collective action. There will be no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated as a class or collective action (<strong>&quot;Class Action Waiver&quot;</strong>).&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>e. <u>Rules/Standards Governing Arbitration Proceeding.</u> A party who wishes to arbitrate a Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement must initiate an arbitration proceeding no later than the expiration of the statute of limitations that applicable law prescribes for the claim asserted. The arbitrator shall apply the statute of limitations that would have applied if the Dispute had been brought in court. The arbitrator may award any remedy to which a party is entitled under applicable law, but remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in their individual capacity, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual under applicable law will be forfeited. The arbitrator is without authority to apply any different substantive law. The parties have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any dispute in this regard shall be decided by the arbitrator. The location of the arbitration proceeding shall take place in the city or county where you reside, unless each party agrees otherwise. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter judgment upon the arbitrator&apos;s decision/award.</p>
                    <p>f. <u>Severability.</u> You and Moba agree that if any portion of this section entitled &quot;Mutual Arbitration Agreement&quot; is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed and the remainder of this section 19 will be given full force and effect.</p>

We may assign or transfer this Agreement without your consent, including but not limited to assignments: (i) to a parent or subsidiary, (ii) to an acquirer of assets, or (iii) to any other successor or acquirer. Any assignment in violation of this section shall be null and void. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of permitted successors and assigns.</p>
                    <p><strong>20.General Provisions.</strong> All provisions that should by their nature survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, including without limitation, Sections 8, 10 and 14-24, shall so survive. No agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee or franchiser-franchisee relationship is intended or created by this Agreement. A failure by us to enforce any provision(s) of this Agreement will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Moba with respect to its subject matter. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will be enforced to the fullest extent possible, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement.

All notices provided by a party in connection with this Agreement will be deemed given as of the day they are received either by email, messenger, delivery service, postage prepaid, certified or registered, return receipt requested, and addressed as follows: Your address for such notices is your email address and/or physical address that you have provided to Moba. Moba&apos;s address for such notices is: info@moba.com.ng, Attn: Legal Manager. The captions in this Agreement are solely for convenience and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.
